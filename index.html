                As leader of the Uchiha, Fugaku was focused on the clan's interest and welfare and had a strong sense of
                responsibility.[1] His son, Sasuke, saw him as a stern and uncaring man while he was seen as a
                father-figure to the rest of the clan. As Itachi was his successor as head of the clan, Fugaku spent
                much of his time focusing on the development of his eldest and little time with his youngest. Sasuke
                trained constantly in order to get his father's attention and approval. Near the end of his life, Fugaku
                had switched his attention to Sasuke, having lost hope in the wayward Itachi. He was only impressed by
                great feats and rarely praised anyone, having high expectations. Fugaku was very serious, hardly smiling
                most of the time. To which, he showed noticeable distaste to Itachi when he would shirk his duties like
                attending meetings and missions.
